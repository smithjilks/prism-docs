# Computations

The computations service provides a means to manage computations, with functions such as computation creation, update, deletion, and running.

## Add Computation

In order to create computation, we can to provide the following content:

```bash
curl -sSiX POST https://prism.ultraviolet.rs/computations -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>" -d @- << EOF
{
  "name": "<name>",
  "description": "<description>",
  "backend_id": <backend_id"
  ]
}
EOF
```

On the ui this can be done on this page as shown here
![Create computation](./img/ui/new%20computation.png)

Example:

```bash
curl -sSiX POST https://prism.ultraviolet.rs/computations -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>" -d @- << EOF
{
  "name": "Machine Diagnostics Analysis",
  "description": "Performing diagnostics analysis on machine data",
  "backend_id": "fde3263e-70b8-4ce9-9f3c-4a203a0dcdf5",
  "agent_config": {
    "log_level": "debug"
  }
}
EOF
```

Response:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

Date: Thu, 02 May 2024 14:29:22 GMT
Content-Length: 0
```

## Retrieve Computations

In order to get all computations:

```bash
curl -sSiX GET https://prism.ultraviolet.rs/computations -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>"
```

Example:

```bash
curl -sSiX GET https://prism.ultraviolet.rs/computations -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>"
```

Response:

```bash
HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/json
date: Mon, 27 May 2024 11:37:50 GMT
x-frame-options: DENY
x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block

```

On the UI the listed computations appear so:

## Retrieve Computation Information

In order to get one specific computation, by ID:

```bash
curl -sSiX GET https://prism.ultraviolet.rs/computations/<computation_id> -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>"
```

Example:

```bash
curl -sSiX GET https://prism.ultraviolet.rs/computations/f025d311-193a-469b-b504-f137e0b768c2 -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>"
```

```

The view computation page appears as below, it also contains buttons to edit, run, delete and view computation logs and events.

## Update Computations Information

In order to update computation:

```bash
curl -sSiX PUT https://prism.ultraviolet.rs/computations/<computation_id> -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>" -d @- <<EOF
{
  "name": "[computation_name]",
  "description": "[computation_description]",
  "datasets": ["[dataset_1]", "[dataset_2]", "[dataset_3]"],
  "algorithm": ["[algorithm_1]", "[algorithm_2]", "[algorithm_3]"],
}
EOF
```

Example:

```bash
curl -sSiX PUT https://prism.ultraviolet.rs/computations/8b131663-058d-4e8f-8ccb-cc83c3f9e694 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>" -d @- <<EOF

## Computation export and import

Prism allows users to export and import computations in both JSON and CSV formats. When exporting as JSON, all details of a computation are bundled into a single file, which can later be imported to recreate the computation with the provided data. Alternatively, multiple computations can be uploaded using a CSV file, which contains the relevant details for each computation. You can find a sample CSV file in the Prism repository [here](https://github.com/ultravioletrs/prism/blob/main/sample_computations.csv). When importing computations, ensure that all user IDs included in the file are valid and correspond to registered users in the workspace, including both backend and user IDs.

A sample computation that can be uploaded as json is shown:

```json

}
```

Upload of computations can be done on the computations page, the files accepted are json and csv.

Any computation can be downloaded by clicking the download button when you view the desired computation.
